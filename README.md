## 1. The Project

### 1.1 Overview
**VectorX** is our self-driving car built for the **World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Future Engineers (FE) 2026** competition. Our goal was to build a fast, reliable car that can navigate an obstacle-filled track autonomously. We 3D-printed our custom chassis & run everything on it using a "dual brain" method. It combines a **Raspberry Pi 5** for image processing & obstacle detection and an **Arduino Uno** for motor & sensor control.

### 1.2 The Challenge
The competition has two main challenges that the car needs to complete - 

* **Open Challenge -** The car must drive **3 consecutive laps** without hitting the walls in the fastest possible time. The drive direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) is randomly picked right before the round. The car needs to steer through sharp 90° turns & stop on its own (at its starting position) after finishing the third lap.
* **Obstacle Challenge -** The car still drives 3 laps, but now there are **red and green traffic pillars** randomly placed on the track. Using the camera, the car must steer to the **right of red pillars** and to the **left of green pillars**. Once 3 laps have been completed, the car will look for the **magenta parking plates** and **parallel park** inside them.
  
### 1.3 Our Approach

When building VectorX, we had 3 simple goals - keeping the electronics stable, making the reaction time as fast as possible, and creating a car that runs reliably.

* **Two Brains -** We split up the computing work so nothing gets overloaded. The **Raspberry Pi 5** handles the camera feed and obstacle detection (OpenCV). The **Arduino Uno** reacts to this by moving the steering servo, adjusting motor speed, and reading sensor inputs.
* **Car-Style Steering -** VectorX steers like a real car - the front wheels use **Ackermann steering** to turn smoothly, and the rear axle uses a **mechanical differential** so the back wheels can spin at slightly different speeds during sharp turns. 
* **Smart Power Supply -** Fast DC motors drain the battery power while accelerating, causing the Raspberry Pi to crash (a brownout). To stop this, our 11.1V battery powers the motors directly, while a regulated 5V buck converter powers the Pi, Arduino, and sensors—all linked safely through a common ground.
* **Combining Multiple Sensors -** No single sensor is perfect, and the track is always changing. Instead of relying on just one input, we combine our **wide-angle camera (Pi Camera Module 3), laser distance sensors (ToF), and gyroscope (IMU)** to double-check every movement & increase accuracy.

### 1.4 System Overview
VectorX works using a simple system - **Sense ➔ Decide ➔ Act**

#### How this Loop Works:

1. **Sense -** The Pi Camera 3 Wide captures live track video, while the ToF distance sensors and MPU-6050 gyro measure wall distances and car orientation.
2. **Decide -** The Raspberry Pi 5 processes the camera feed using OpenCV to detect red/green traffic pillars and track lines. It calculates the necessary steering angle and target speed, then sends these commands to the Arduino over the USB cable.
3. **Act -** The Arduino Uno receives the speed and steering values, adjusts the REV Smart Servo for front-wheel Ackermann steering, and controls power to the drive motor via the TB6612FNG driver.

## 5. Mechanical & Mobility System

### 5.1 Chassis & Kinematics
### 5.2 Drive System & Differential
### 5.3 Steering System
### 5.4 Motors, Drivers & Selection Rationale

#### Drive Motor Driver
<img width="400" alt="Motor Driver Module" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e974975c-841e-4834-8ada-cf40c2051d88" />

* **Model:** Cytron 13A Single DC Motor Driver
* **Operating Voltage & Current:** 5V–30V, 13A Continuous (30A Peak)
* **Interface:** PWM Speed & DIR Digital Control from Microcontroller
* **Primary Function:** Drives the main rear DC motor based on steering PID outputs.
* **Selection Rationale ("Why We Chose It"):** Unlike standard L298N drivers (which drop ~2V across internal transistors and overheat), the NMOS design of the Cytron delivers near 100% battery power efficiency without overheating during rapid acceleration runs.

---

#### Steering Servo Motor
<img width="400" alt="REV Servo Motor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/112df6cb-7e90-4af8-a5c2-14de61a694c0" />

* **Model:** REV Smart Robot Servo V2 / MG996R
* **Type:** Digital High-Torque Metal-Gear Servo
* **Interface:** PWM Signal Pin (`D9` on Microcontroller)
* **Primary Function:** Operates the front Ackermann steering rack.
* **Selection Rationale ("Why We Chose It"):** Metal gears prevent stripping during high-speed wall impacts. High stall torque (>10 kg·cm) ensures instantaneous response times when the PID controller requests rapid corrective steering angles in tight corners.

---

### 5.5 Speed & Torque Calculations
* **Vehicle Mass ($m$):** [e.g., 1.2 kg]
* **Target Linear Speed ($v$):** [e.g., 1.5 m/s]
* **Wheel Diameter ($d$) & Radius ($r$):** [e.g., 65mm / 0.0325m]
* **Gear Ratio:** [e.g., 1:10]
* **Torque Reasoning:** Equations proving motor stall/operating torque ($T = F \cdot r$) can accelerate the vehicle without exceeding motor thermal limits.

### 6.3 Power Budget Table
| Component Domain | Powered Hardware | Power Source / Voltage | Max Current Draw |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### 6.5 Sensors & Component Selection Rationale

#### Vision Camera
<img width="400" alt="Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Wide" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c6cab85-ed41-4f66-8147-8fbd5683255c" />

* **Model:** Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Wide
* **Sensor & Resolution:** Sony IMX708 (12 Megapixel), 1080p @ 50fps
* **Interface:** CSI (Camera Serial Interface) directly to SBC
* **Primary Function:** Captures live track frames for BGR-to-HSV color filtering, identifying red/green pillars, and locating magenta parallel parking bounds.
* **Selection Rationale ("Why We Chose It"):** We selected the 120° wide-angle version over the standard 75° camera. The ultra-wide field of view allows the vision system to detect wall corners and red/green traffic pillars earlier when negotiating sharp 90° turns, eliminating the need for complex pan-tilt mechanisms.

#### Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
<img width="400" alt="MPU6050 IMU Module" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43787b9a-8cb0-4fca-b6b4-922ac4cd07ab" />

* **Model:** MPU-6050
* **Sensor Type:** 6-Axis Motion Tracking (3-Axis Gyroscope + 3-Axis Accelerometer)
* **Interface:** I2C (`SDA` / `SCL`)
* **Primary Function:** Measures yaw rate and angular heading velocity to maintain straight-line stability and assist turn verification.
* **Selection Rationale ("Why We Chose It"):** Offers high sample rates (up to 1kHz) with minimal power consumption (~3.9mA). Its built-in Digital Motion Processor (DMP) offloads sensor-fusion calculations from our primary microcontroller.

---

#### Distance Sensors
<img width="400" alt="TOF200C Distance Sensor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e50b81-aab1-44f8-a4a9-a0db099a9dc4" />

* **Model:** TOF200C (VL53L0X Time-of-Flight Sensor)
* **Type:** Laser Time-of-Flight (ToF) Distance Sensor
* **Interface:** I2C
* **Primary Function:** Measures millimeter-exact distances to track walls for collision avoidance and parallel parking alignment.
* **Selection Rationale ("Why We Chose It"):** Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) suffer from wide 15° beam reflection angles and echo interference when bouncing off smooth track walls at an angle. Time-of-Flight laser sensors use a narrow infrared beam, giving reliable distance readings regardless of wall color or angle.
