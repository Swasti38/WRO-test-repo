## 1. The Project

### 1.1 Overview
**VectorX** is our self-driving car built for the **World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Future Engineers (FE) 2026** competition. Our goal was to build a fast, reliable car that can navigate an obstacle-filled track autonomously. We 3D-printed our custom chassis & run everything on it using a "dual brain" method. It combines a **Raspberry Pi 5** for image processing & obstacle detection and an **Arduino Uno** for motor & sensor control.

#### Key Performance Specs
* **Dimensions -** x mm × y mm × z mm (Fits WRO 300mm x 200mm limit)
* **Steering -** Front Ackermann Steering (REV Smart Servo)
* **Drive System -** Rear Mechanical Differential driven by DC Motor
* **Dual-Brain Compute -** Raspberry Pi 5 + Arduino Uno

### 1.2 The Challenge
The competition has two main challenges that the car needs to complete - 

* **Open Challenge -** The car must drive **3 consecutive laps** without hitting the walls in the fastest possible time. The drive direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) is randomly picked right before the round. The car needs to steer through sharp 90° turns & stop on its own (at its starting position) after finishing the third lap.
* **Obstacle Challenge -** The car still drives 3 laps, but now there are **red and green traffic pillars** randomly placed on the track. Using the camera, the car must steer to the **right of red pillars** and to the **left of green pillars**. Once 3 laps have been completed, the car will look for the **magenta parking plates** and **parallel park** inside them.
  
### 1.3 Our Approach

When building VectorX, we had 3 simple goals - keeping the electronics stable, making the reaction time as fast as possible, and creating a car that runs reliably.

* **Two Brains -** We split up the computing work so nothing gets overloaded. The **Raspberry Pi 5** handles the camera feed and obstacle detection (OpenCV). The **Arduino Uno** reacts to this by moving the steering servo, adjusting motor speed, and reading sensor inputs.
* **Car-Style Steering -** VectorX steers like a real car - the front wheels use **Ackermann steering** to turn smoothly, and the rear axle uses a **mechanical differential** so the back wheels can spin at slightly different speeds during sharp turns. 
* **Smart Power Supply -** Fast DC motors drain the battery power while accelerating, causing the Raspberry Pi to crash (a brownout). To stop this, our 11.1V battery powers the motors directly, while a regulated 5V buck converter powers the Pi, Arduino, and sensors—all linked safely through a common ground.
* **Combining Multiple Sensors -** No single sensor is perfect, and the track is always changing. Instead of relying on just one input, we combine our **wide-angle camera (Pi Camera Module 3), laser distance sensors (ToF), and gyroscope (IMU)** to double-check every movement & increase accuracy.

### 1.4 System Overview
VectorX works using a simple system - **Sense ➔ Decide ➔ Act**

#### How this Loop Works:

1. **Sense -** The Pi Camera 3 Wide captures live track video, while the ToF distance sensors and MPU-6050 gyro measure wall distances and car orientation.
2. **Decide -** The Raspberry Pi 5 processes the camera feed using OpenCV to detect red/green traffic pillars and track lines. It calculates the necessary steering angle and target speed, then sends these commands to the Arduino over the USB cable.
3. **Act -** The Arduino Uno receives the speed and steering values, adjusts the REV Smart Servo for front-wheel Ackermann steering, and controls power to the drive motor via the TB6612FNG driver.
